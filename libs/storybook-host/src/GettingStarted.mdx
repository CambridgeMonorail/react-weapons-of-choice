## Introduction

Welcome to the React Weapons of Choice (RWOC) monorepo. This document provides an overview of the various libraries available within the monorepo, each designed to help you build a consistent, maintainable, and cohesive application.

## Overview of Libraries

#### 1. **`@rwoc/component-library`**
- **Description**: A collection of reusable UI components designed to be used across various projects within the monorepo. The library includes components such as buttons, cards, dialogs, and more.
- **Usage**: Import and use these components to build consistent and cohesive user interfaces.
- **Example**:

- **Usage**: Use these components to maintain a cohesive design system throughout the application.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { Switch, Table, TableRow, TableCell } from '@rwoc/shadcnui';

  const Settings = () => (
    <div>
      <Switch checked={true} onCheckedChange={() => {}} />
      <Table>
        <TableRow>
          <TableCell>Item 1</TableCell>
          <TableCell>Item 2</TableCell>
        </TableRow>
      </Table>
    </div>
  );
  ```

#### 3. **`@rwoc/common-tailwind`**
- **Description**: A library containing common Tailwind CSS configurations and utility classes used across the monorepo. It includes preflight styles and theme configurations.
- **Usage**: Import the CSS files to apply consistent styling and utility classes throughout the application.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  @import '@rwoc/common-tailwind/src/preflight.css';

  ```

#### 4. **`@rwoc/landing`**
- **Description**: A library containing components and sections specifically designed for the landing pages of the application. It includes sections like Hero, About, Community, and more.
