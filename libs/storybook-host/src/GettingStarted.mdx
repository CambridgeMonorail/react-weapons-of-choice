## Introduction

Welcome to the React Weapons of Choice (erisfy) monorepo. This document provides an overview of the various libraries available within the monorepo, each designed to help you build a consistent, maintainable, and cohesive application.

## Overview of Libraries

#### 1. **`@erisfy/shadcnui`**
- **Description**: A library providing base UI components styled with @erisfy/shadcnui, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application. It includes components like switches, tables, and more.
- **Usage**: Use these components to maintain a cohesive design system throughout the application.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { Switch, Table, TableRow, TableCell } from '@erisfy/shadcnui';

  const Settings = () => (
    <div>
      <Switch checked={true} onCheckedChange={() => {}} />
      <Table>
        <TableRow>
          <TableCell>Item 1</TableCell>
          <TableCell>Item 2</TableCell>
        </TableRow>
      </Table>
    </div>
  );
  ```

#### 2. **`@erisfy/shadcnui-blocks`**
- **Description**: A collection of composite UI components built from the base Shadcn UI components. The library includes components such as buttons, cards, dialogs, and more.
- **Usage**: Import and use these components to build consistent and cohesive user interfaces.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { Button, Card, Dialog } from '@erisfy/shadcnui-blocks';

  const App = () => (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
      <Card title="Card Title">Card Content</Card>
      <Dialog isOpen={true} onClose={() => {}}>
        Dialog Content
      </Dialog>
    </div>
  );
  ```

#### 3. **`@erisfy/common-tailwind`**
- **Description**: A library containing common Tailwind CSS configurations and utility classes used across the monorepo. It includes preflight styles and theme configurations.
- **Usage**: Import the CSS files to apply consistent styling and utility classes throughout the application.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  @import '@erisfy/common-tailwind/src/preflight.css';
  @import '@erisfy/common-tailwind/src/shadcn-theme.css';
  ```

#### 4. **`@erisfy/landing`**
- **Description**: A library containing components and sections specifically designed for the landing pages of the application. It includes sections like Hero, About, CTA, and more.
- **Usage**: Use these components to build engaging and informative landing pages.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { HeroSection, AboutSection, CTASection } from '@erisfy/landing';

    <div>
      <HeroSection title="Welcome" subtitle="Discover our platform" />

  ```

#### 5. **`@erisfy/shell`**
- **Description**: A library providing layout components and utilities for the overall structure of the application. It includes components like `Layout`, `AppSidebar`, `Breadcrumb`, and more.

      <main>
        {/* Main content */}
      </main>
    </Layout>
  );
  ```

### Summary

The monorepo is organized into several libraries, each serving a specific purpose to ensure a modular, maintainable, and cohesive codebase. These libraries include:

- **`@erisfy/shadcnui`**: Base @erisfy/shadcnui components.
- **`@erisfy/shadcnui-blocks`**: Composite UI components built from @erisfy/shadcnui components.
