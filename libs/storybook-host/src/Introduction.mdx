# Welcome to the Component Library

## Overview

This component library is a key part of the **React Weapons of Choice** monorepo, an open-source boilerplate designed to streamline the development of single-page React applications (SPAs). By integrating powerful tools like **Nx** for monorepo management, **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, and **@rwoc/shadcnui** for customizable UI components, this project provides developers with a robust and efficient starting point for building modern client-side applications.

## Why Build with Components?

Building with components offers several significant advantages:

- **Reusability**: Components serve as modular building blocks that can be reused across different parts of an application or even in multiple projects, reducing redundancy and promoting consistency.

- **Maintainability**: Isolated components simplify debugging and updates. Changes in one component have minimal impact on others, making the codebase easier to manage and scale over time.

- **Scalability**: A component-based architecture allows for building scalable and modular applications, making it easier to maintain and expand as the project grows.

- **Performance Optimization**: React's use of a virtual DOM ensures that only the components with changed data are re-rendered, enhancing application performance and providing a smoother user experience.

By leveraging these features, React's component-based architecture streamlines the development process, allowing developers to build robust and efficient applications more rapidly.

## Component Structure

Our component library follows the principles of Atomic Design, which breaks down the UI into smaller, reusable pieces:

- **Base Components**: These are the fundamental building blocks, often derived from **@rwoc/shadcnui** components, and can be found in the `libs/shadcnui` directory.

- **Composite Components**: These are composed of multiple base components to form more complex, reusable blocks. They can be found in the `libs/shadcnui-blocks` directory.

- **Sections**: These are higher-level components that combine composite components to create sections of a page. They can be quickly used to build entire pages and are located in the `libs/landing` directory.

By organizing components in this manner, we ensure a clear separation of concerns and promote reusability and maintainability.
