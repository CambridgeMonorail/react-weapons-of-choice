# Shell Library

The `shell` library provides a set of reusable components and layouts designed to create a consistent and customizable shell for your application. These components are built using modern React practices, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring they are type-safe, maintainable, and easy to integrate into any project.

## Why React?

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It emphasizes the creation of reusable components, which can be composed together to build complex UIs. This component-based architecture promotes code reuse, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Reusable Components

The components in the `shell` library are designed to be flexible and reusable. They follow best practices for accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring they work well across different devices and screen sizes. By using these components, you can quickly build consistent and high-quality UIs without reinventing the wheel.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe**: Written in TypeScript to provide strong typing and reduce runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Utilizes shadcn/ui components for a consistent look and feel.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind to ensure all users can interact with the components.
- **Responsive**: Designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes.

## Example Components

- **MenubarLayout**: A layout component that provides a menubar for navigation, adapting to mobile and desktop views.

## Usage

To use the components from the `shell` library, simply import them into your React project and start building your UI. Here's an example of how to use the `MenubarLayout` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { MenubarLayout } from 'shell';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MenubarLayout>
      <div className="p-4">
        {/* Your content goes here */}
      </div>
    </MenubarLayout>
  );
};

export default App;
```

By leveraging these reusable components, you can streamline your development process and ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across your application.
