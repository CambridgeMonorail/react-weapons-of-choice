## Overview

An open-source boilerplate designed to simplify the development of single-page React applications (SPAs). By leveraging Nx, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, this project offers developers a seamless and efficient starting point for building modern front-end applications. It is ideal for those who prefer not to use Next.js or cannot use it but still want the benefits of this powerful toolset.

Inspired by and based upon [joshuarobs/nx-shadcn-ui-monorepo](https://github.com/joshuarobs/nx-shadcn-ui-monorepo).

Thanks to the help from this tutorial here: <https://medium.com/readytowork-org/monorepo-setup-with-nx-nextjs-and-shadcn-ui-3b72c3599470>

## Project Goals

- **Simplified Setup**: Provide a ready-to-use boilerplate for developers looking to build SPAs using modern tools without SSR or Next.js.
- **Seamless Integration**: Combine Nx for monorepo management, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and Shadcn UI for cohesive, customizable UI components.
- **Scalability and Modularity**: Offer a scalable architecture with reusable libraries and clear boundaries between projects.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Deliver a well-documented, intuitive, and maintainable codebase to boost productivity and reduce onboarding time.
- **Community Collaboration**: Foster an open-source community to innovate, improve, and expand the project.

For a detailed breakdown of the project goals, see [Project Goals](./docs/project-goals.md).

## Features

- üèó **Nx Monorepo**: Modular and scalable workspace for managing multiple projects and libraries.
- üé® **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
- üñå **Shadcn UI**: A customizable component library for consistent and reusable design patterns.
- ‚ö° **Vite**: Fast and efficient development server and build tool.
- üöÄ **CI/CD Integration**: Preconfigured workflows for automated builds and testing.

## Why This Project Was Built

While tools like Nx, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI are incredibly powerful and offer numerous benefits for modern front-end development, the process of configuring them can still be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating, even for experienced developers. This is because setting up such architectures from scratch is an infrequent task, and each setup can have its own unique challenges and nuances.

This project was built to address these challenges by providing a pre-configured, ready-to-use boilerplate that simplifies the initial setup process. By leveraging this boilerplate, developers can quickly start building their applications without worrying about the complexities of configuration, allowing them to focus on writing code and delivering features.

For more details on why a React SPA boilerplate may still have some value in a Next.js world, see [Why a React SPA Boilerplate in a Next.js World?](./docs/why-spa-why.md)

# Make This Your Own

Follow these steps to fork and customize the boilerplate for your own project.

---

## 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the **original** repository on GitHub.  
2. Click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner to create a personal copy under your GitHub account.  
3. For detailed instructions, refer to GitHub‚Äôs [Fork a repo documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

---

## 2. Clone the Forked Repository

1. Locate the **forked** repository on your GitHub account.  
2. Click the **Code** button and copy the repository‚Äôs URL.  
3. Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-forked-repo>.git
    ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-forked-repo>` with the repository name.

---

## 3. Update Project Identifiers

You can update project identifiers either **manually** or by using the **setup script** included in this boilerplate.

### 3.1 Manual Update

1. Perform a global **search and replace** across the codebase to update:
   - Project name  
   - URLs  
   - Branding elements  
   - Any other relevant identifiers  

2. Ensure **all** instances of the original project name are replaced with your new project name.

### 3.2 Using the Setup Script

1. **Install project dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2. **Run the setup script**:

    ```bash
    pnpm run setup
    ```

   The script will prompt you to replace:
   - **Organization**: e.g., ‚ÄúCambridgeMonorail‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúYourOrgName‚Äù  
   - **Machine-Readable App Name**: e.g., ‚Äúreact-weapons-of-choice‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúmy-awesome-app‚Äù  
   - **Human-Readable App Name**: e.g., ‚ÄúReact Weapons of Choice‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúMy Awesome App‚Äù  
   - **Abbreviation**: e.g., ‚Äúrwoc‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúmaa‚Äù  

   You will also have the option to set a **new Git remote** URL.

---

## 4. Modify Configuration Files

1. Review and update configuration files‚Äîsuch as `package.json` and `.env`‚Äîto align them with your project‚Äôs requirements.  
2. Adjust metadata, dependencies, environment variables, and other project-specific settings as needed.

---

## 5. Review Documentation

1. **Replace** references to the original project with your new project details.  
2. Update any relevant documentation (e.g., README, wiki pages) to reflect your project‚Äôs context and branding.

---

## 6. Set Up a New Remote Repository

1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub for your customized project.  
2. In your terminal, **navigate** to your project‚Äôs directory and run:

    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-new-repo>.git
    ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-new-repo>` with the new repository name.

---

## 7. Push Changes to the New Repository

1. Push your local changes to the new remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

   Make sure your local branch is named `main`. If not, replace `main` with the correct branch name.

---

## 8. Install Dependencies and Initialize Git Hooks

1. **Install** any required dependencies (if you haven‚Äôt already):

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2. **Set up Git hooks** or other initialization scripts:

    ```bash
    pnpm run prepare
    ```

   This typically configures hooks like pre-commit or lint-staged checks.

---

By following these steps, you can fully customize the boilerplate to fit your project‚Äôs needs while maintaining a clean, organized codebase.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
