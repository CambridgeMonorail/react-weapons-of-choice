  Define how tests should be generated, including which frameworks to use or specific testing styles.  
  - *Example*: Ensure all tests use Jest with a particular structure and style.

- **Code Review Instructions**  
  Customize how Copilot performs code reviews by specifying what to look for, such as security vulnerabilities or style inconsistencies.  
  - *Example*: Ask Copilot to check for SQL injection risks in database queries.

- **Commit Message Generation Instructions**  
  Provide guidelines for how commit messages should be formatted, ensuring consistency across the team.  
  - *Example*: Automatically generate commit messages in a conventional commit format.

### Why Use Custom Copilot Instructions?

- **Enhanced Productivity**: Automate repetitive guidance and avoid manually providing context in every prompt.  
- **Team Consistency**: Ensure Copilot aligns with your team’s agreed-upon practices for code, tests, reviews, and commit messages.
