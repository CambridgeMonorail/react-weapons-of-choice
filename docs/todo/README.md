## How to Use This Section

This section tracks planned work that hasn't been implemented yet. Before starting work on any TODO item:

1. Check if there's already an open GitHub issue
2. Create an issue if one doesn't exist
3. Reference the issue in your PR
4. Update or remove the TODO doc when work is complete

## Converting TODOs to Issues

Use the `@requirements-planner` agent to help break down TODO items into actionable GitHub issues with implementation plans.
