- Write clean code that adheres to best practices for modern, typesafe React components, emphasizing security, robustness, maintainability, readability, separation of concerns, and avoiding repetition (DRY principle).
- Use React functional components exclusively.
- Utilize hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- Apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling components.
- Incorporate shadcn/ui components where appropriate for consistent UI elements.
- Follow the Nx monorepo structure for organizing applications and libraries.
- Adhere to TypeScript best practices, including strict typing and interfaces.
- Implement Vitest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing.
- Ensure all components are accessible and responsive.
- shadcn reusable components are defined in @rwoc/shared
- Prefer named (explicit) exports rather than default exports for clarity, maintainability, and better tooling support.
- Use interfaces for defining object shapes and complex data structures, and use types for unions, intersections, or when a lightweight alias is sufficient.
- Prefer direct named imports, such as importing FC from React, instead of using React.FC.
- Projects should use relative imports to import from other files within the same project.
