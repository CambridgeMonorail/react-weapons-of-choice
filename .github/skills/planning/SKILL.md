# Planning Skill

This skill defines how to create structured implementation plans for non-trivial work in this repository.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Plan new features with multiple components
- Structure refactoring work across multiple files
- Break down complex bug fixes
- Make architectural decisions

## Plan Template

See [detailed plan template](workflows/detailed-guide.md) for complete structure with examples.

## Key Elements

Every plan must include:
1. **Goal** - What you're trying to achieve
2. **Context** - Why this is needed
3. **Task breakdown** - Specific, actionable steps
4. **For each task:**
   - Files to change
   - Commands to run
   - Expected result
   - Acceptance criteria

## Integration

- Reference from [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) workflow guidance
- Plans live in `docs/plans/` directory
- Update plan status as work progresses

For complete examples and detailed guidance, see the [detailed planning guide](workflows/detailed-guide.md).
