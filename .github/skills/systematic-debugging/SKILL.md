# Systematic Debugging Skill

This skill provides a structured approach to debugging that finds root causes instead of treating symptoms.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Debug complex or non-obvious issues
- Investigate performance problems
- Find the root cause of unexpected behavior
- Verify a bug fix actually works

## The 6-Step Process

1. **Understand the Problem**
2. **Reproduce Reliably**
3. **Find Root Cause** (Don't guess - investigate)
4. **Fix the Root Cause**
5. **Verify the Fix**
6. **Document**

## Integration
